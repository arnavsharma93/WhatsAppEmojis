Convert ASCII smileys to graphical emojis in WhatApp Web - Chrome Extension

### What is this?
This is Chrome Extension, which converts plain text emojis to graphical emojis used by WhatsApp in WhatsApp Web. For example, it convers ":D" to :smile:.

### Why?
Because it was a lot of trouble to click too many times to get an emoji. And, I could not just use ASCII emojis as the people I used to chat using WhatsApp could not understand those :P

So, I decided to do something about it.. And this is it. Not a big, but extemely useful piece of code. So, I thought it would be nice if this can be useful to someone else like me!

### Something missing?
I've just added a few emojis which I frequantly use. If you want more, update the file `content.js`. Also, send a PR if you feel so! :P
